        <p>
          I am a previous special education teacher with 5 years experience
          within a public school setting. I have worked in various different
          environments adapting to rapidly changing situations, working
          collaboratively with others, and meeting deadlines. I have utilized
          the UConn coding bootcamp to expand my skillset and understanding
          within tech.
